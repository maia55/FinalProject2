## Description

**Our final project is about finding the best place to move in case of a zombie apocalypse using 3 datasets from the WPRDC website.** 

We decided to do the metric on finding the best neighborhood in case of a zombie apocalypse because we wanted to do something unexpected and a fictional metric was more fun to play around with. Before coming up wih our idea, we looked at all the datasets. Ultimately, the datasets of Bridges and Parks in the City of Pittsburgh led us to our metric of finding the best neighborhood in the case of a Zombie Apocalypse. 

Our datasets are parks, bridges, and population. For parks, having more parks means that there is more space to hide or avoid zombies if you have to. For bridges, the more bridges connected to a neighborhood, the easier it is to remain remote from other neighborhoods and decrease the amount of routes and entrances for zombies to enter from. For population, the goal was to find the best neighborhood with the lowest population in Pittsburgh.
